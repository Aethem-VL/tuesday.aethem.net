Many of the items that we are scheduling for research (read that *things we're going to break apart and dissect*) have to do with actively watching the processes as a function goes from the frontend to the database, and what the means when the dust clears. For the moment, [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) is our target. It can be based on MySQL, MariaDB, or Percona, but we are going to probably run with Maria, depending on what our cloud host allows us to play with.

### Why do we care?

Wordpress has become a *de facto* CMS for blogging, corporate sites, ecommerce, and all sorts of nonsense. It seems that maybe we should know a little more about how it works, in a way that can be easily understood and perhaps even taught. But we don't know exactly how it works, how it's put together, how all the little cogs and pieces fit and work, and that irks the living daylights out of us.

So we'll break it apart, dissect it, and examine it. We'll tell you what the guts look like. We might even show pictures.

We want to know several different things, and we hope to write it all up in a nice little document, but will probably just post articles on here for now.
