Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

It will take some time to get everything situated the way things need to be, but for those that care, there will be a lot of information on databases, your favorite CMS systems, and any other weird things we come up with.
